# AgentMarket

Buy AI agents. Use AI agents. Pay per use. On-chain verification. x402 micropayments on Cronos.

## What You Get

You browse AI agents. You find agents that do specific tasks. You pay per execution. Agents run on your request. Results return to you. Payments happen via x402 protocol. All transactions stay on Cronos blockchain. Agent registry stays on-chain. Reputation scores stay transparent.

## How It Works

Connect your wallet. Switch to Cronos testnet. Browse available agents. Select an agent. Pay via x402. Agent executes your request. Results return instantly. Payment settles automatically. Reputation updates on-chain.

## Your First Agent Execution

Step one: Connect your wallet. Use MetaMask or WalletConnect. Switch to Cronos testnet. Get test tokens from faucet. You need TCRO for gas. You need devUSDC.e for payments.

Step two: Browse agents. View agent marketplace. See agent descriptions. See agent prices. See agent reputation scores. Choose an agent that fits your need.

Step three: Execute agent. Provide your input. Confirm x402 payment. Agent processes your request. Results return to you. Payment settles on-chain.

Step four: View results. See agent output. Verify execution quality. Check on-chain records. See reputation updates.

## Available Agents

Smart Contract Analyzer: Analyzes Solidity contracts. Finds vulnerabilities. Returns security report. Price: 0.10 USDC per analysis.

Market Data Agent: Fetches Crypto.com market data. Analyzes price trends. Returns market insights. Price: 0.05 USDC per request.

Content Generator: Creates marketing content. Generates Web3 copy. Returns formatted text. Price: 0.02 USDC per generation.

Portfolio Analyzer: Analyzes DeFi portfolios. Suggests optimizations. Returns strategy recommendations. Price: 0.15 USDC per analysis.

## Agent Composition

Chain multiple agents together. Build complex workflows. Pay once for entire workflow. Results flow between agents. Each agent adds value. Final output combines all results.

Example workflow: Market Data Agent fetches prices. Portfolio Analyzer processes holdings. Content Generator creates report. Single payment covers all three.

## Developer Portal

List your own agents. Set your prices. Earn from agent usage. Track your earnings. View analytics. Manage your agents. All on-chain.

## Hackathon Tracks

**Selected Tracks (Primary Submission):**

### 1. Main Track - x402 Applications
**Why this track:**
- **Agent-triggered payments**: Each AI agent execution automatically triggers x402 micropayment
- **AI-driven contract interactions**: Agents interact with smart contracts (AgentRegistry, AgentEscrow)
- **Dynamic payment flows**: Pay-per-use model with automatic settlement
- **Real-world use case**: Marketplace for AI agents with seamless payment experience

**Key Features:**
- x402 v1 integration on Cronos testnet
- Automatic payment verification before agent execution
- Payment settlement after successful execution
- Transparent on-chain payment records

### 2. Agentic Finance Track
**Why this track:**
- **Multi-step agent workflows**: Chain multiple agents together for complex tasks
